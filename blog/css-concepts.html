    <h1>Margin, Border, and Padding</h1>

          Here we have a man named Charles. Charles is a hardworker. He enjoys his daily life as one of about a dozen accountants who work for a mid-large sized, international branding agency. Charles takes his paid vacation time when he goes to other countries for business. This level-headed businessman spends his afternoons relaxing on the beach--soaking up the sun along with a few of his friends outside of work. The beach is Charles' happy place, and his favorite chair/umbrella combo acts as his sanctuary. To some, accountancy may seem like a stable career where people can work on their skills for years and have a job for life doing about the same thing for whichever company they choose. Charles, on the other hand, is a man of vision. He uses his time out of the office to reflect on his time, and to expose areas of his life that can be improved. In short, he penny-pinches. He looks for the little details that can make a big difference in the long run. This time of reflection is a deeply personal experience for Charles. Possibilities cascade across his mindscape and universes collide. His future and past blend together to create a collage of interwoven moments along a path that to him feels like it's paved with platinum. Charles does not wish to be disturbed during these precious moments of introspection. If interrupted, he has been known to behave erratically. It is common knowledge among his friends that while Charles sits in his chair and stares out into the ocean, it is best for everyone involved for him to be left alone.

          Elements in HTML want to protect their content, as Charles wants to protect his train of thought. Fortunately, the content is surrounded by three layers of boxes, just as Charles' thought processes are protected by his aura, body, and brain. Margin is a CSS property that surrounds an element and acts similar to Charles' obvious air of 'Do Not Disturb'. The margin is the outermost layer that protects the content. If the element's margin is greater than 0, it is requesting that other elements respect its personal space. As the margin increases, so does the breadth of that element's sensitivity bubble.

          Border is the second layer of protection. Borders can be invisible, or they can be a solid, dotted, or dashed line that outlines the element. Charles may decide that lifting weights and bulking up will help keep pesky intruders at bay while he meditates, and elements can do the same with borders. Borders can be styled to be many pixels thick or not.

          The final layer before the content is Padding. If we define Charles' thoughts as the electricity firing off in the synapses of his brain, then Padding is like the grey brain matter that holds these synapses in place. Padding is in between the content and the border, and acts as a buffer zone to keep the precious content isolated even from its own protection. I mean, we can't have our brains bumping up against our skulls when we move the wrong way, right?
