        Breathe in. Breathe out. Look left and right. Now look here: you are a programmer. There is no magic wand that I can wave to make you understand what it will take to conquer the concepts that you must practice and eventually master. I imagine you are hoping, as I once did, that I will light the way with my Olympic Torch of Freedom and scare away the shadows and creepers that watch hungrily as you stumble along the unfamiliar road, but fret not. You have your compass and your map, and you  have precisely plotted your course. However, no matter how meticulous you might be, no matter how many checks and balances you run on your sanity account, the Path Master will inevitably send you challenges. The Path Master is the all-seer--the omnipotent presence that lurks even in the light. It (and "it" is appropriate, as the Path Master transcends classification) knows where you want to go and what you must do to get there. The Path Master uses its clairvoyance to search your mind so that it might discern the direction of your attention. If you are focused and dilligent, the Path Master is pleased. If you waver and try to do too much, the Path Master smirks slyly and sends a snake to scare you off course. The Path Master wants you to succeed; it really does, but it has a devilish sense of humor and relentless patience. To win at its game, we must be like the Path Master itself. We must be cunning, patient and disciplined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cunning, patience and discipline will aid you well in your adventures as you navigate the Computer Underworld, also known as the Unix operating system. The Underworld is archaic compared to the web we know and love and the Cloud we enjoy yet don't fully understand, and it has its own powerful set of rules that you must abide by lest you disturb the Path Master and invoke its dreaded, but helpful error messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, you must find your patience. Look within yourself. Look at the wall. Look at your cat. Look anywhere and everywhere to find the holiest of virtues that will ease your troubled mind and keep your laptop from meeting the stubborn pavement outside your apartment window. You must decide to make patience your practice, or you will defeat yourself before the Path Master even gets a chance to. Take a moment to internally commit yourself to the practice of patience. Say to yourself, "No matter what challenges I face in the Underworld, I will persevere with stubborn gladness. No matter how many times I run myself in circles in that dimly lit labyrinth, I will smile and start again." Okay, now that you are committed, keep your eyes forward and boldly greet the Path Master as the door to the Underworld swings open to reveal...

        The Command Line.

        This thing of legend is your digital swiss army knife. It has every tool you need programmed into it, but it is only as powerful as its weilder. You must learn the tools it holds and know when to use them. Your Command Line can access the entire interface of your computer, and  with the Command Line's help, you can use the tools at your disposal to control and shape your computer's environment and efficiently navigate through the Forrest of Files and Folders. You can use the Command Line to prune the trees and leaves (folders and files, respectively) as you see fit, and you can open a channel to the Webworld above by building on the branches of your Folder trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you take your first steps into the Underworld, the Path Master immediately assimilates into your mind and confronts you with choices. Which way should you go? Which tree should you climb? You amble over to your documents because they are safe and familiar and you figure you can dink around safely. You confidently climb the tree and balance on a branch of throwaway files that mean nothing to you. You figure out how to open them in a text editor and you add some relevant jargon. Then you decide you have the hang of the text files, and you realize you have a report due the next morning. Now you say, "Hey, what a time to practice my Command skills and finish my report." The first thing you do is open the file. The second thing you do is make some edits. The third thing you do is save the file and smile as though you've accomplished something. Fourth, you throw a fantastic freak-out when it dawns on you that you overwrote an important segment that you have no way of rehashing. You're panicking; you'll be fired; your partner will leave you. In your mind, you see yourself curled up in a swath of damp, dirty rags under a bridge. You look up, and in the branches of the trees surrounding the bridge you see a raccoon. Something stirs within you, and you turn your head slightly towards the curious creature. It has three bold letters made of denser, darker fur on its chest that read "Git". Suddenly, you jerk backwards as the Path Master forcibly exits your mind, and you realize it was just a trick. You are still in the Underworld. You have the memory of editing your files, but it never actually happened. The image of the raccoon is burned on the inside of your eyelids, and you decide to do some research. Turns out, "Git" is a system that will save you from nightmares like the one you were just subject to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, with a toy as alluringly dangerous as the Command Line, you may feel like a toddler with a lightsaber, foolishly hacking away at your surroundings. To keep from being spanked by the Path Master, you can discipline your approach with the help of Git and version control. Version control is a process that Git uses to track changes to the projects you are working on. Say you open that report once again, and you overwrite that imporant segment once again, only this time you used _git add_ and _git commit_ to save a snapshot of what your work looked like before. Git can go back to a previous save point, and load the file as it was before you unwittingly truncated your precious segment. You can make new save points all day long to your work and Git will save the snapshots in a timeline for you to revisit as you please. A walk through your very own history museum.
      </p>
      <p>
        With your newfound saving ability, your adventurous spirit is enflamed once more. You find a different tree to climb and you scurry smoothly up the trunk to the branches above. You climb up and down the branches, and eventually peak your head out of the leaves. Your eyes slowly come to rest on the familiar furry face of the raccoon you met in your dream. Amazingly, he is floating above the trees with a fishing pole in his hands and basket on his back. You look around and are shocked to find that you are not the only adventurer in this seemingly endless wood. You call out to them but they seem to not hear you, and you notice that they are a figment of your imagination. They cannot interact with you and your Underworld. However, these people are passing their very real projects to the raccoon by wrapping them in cloth and hooking them onto his fishing line. The raccoon (let's call him Alfred) takes the bags, deposits them in his basket, and defying physics, dumps the basket straight upward into the Webworld. You continue to watch, enthralled by the magic. Moments later, a cloth ball falls from the sky into Alfred's basket. He takes the ball, reads the tag, and sends it flying into the arms of a specific adventurer in a specific tree. This image of tree, to Alfred, to sky is similar to how you can send saved versions of your projects to GitHub using Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        GitHub is a part of the Webworld that is accessible to all the other adventurers toiling away in their respective Underworlds. In this narrative, the way Alfred caught the projects swaddled in cloth, and subsequently shot the project into the sky is similar to the process of pushing saved versions of your projects to GitHub. GitHub is a safe place where adventurers can emerge from the depths of their Underworld and commune with their fellows while collaborating on master versions of projects that they have brought with them. You can view the saved history of any traveler's campaign, and weathered veterans can share their wealth of wisdom and knowledge to smooth the road of the rugged wayfarer. This is what makes GitHub so important. It is a platform where people with real street smarts can share their knowledge and contribute to make projects even more beautiful.
