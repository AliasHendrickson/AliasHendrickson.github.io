  <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <p>
    Arrays are ordered collections of objects. The order is kept by an index that keeps track of the consecutive placement of each object. Each slot in an array points to any kind of object that the user would like to place in there. The slot placement is the number in the index.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can think of arrays like a file cabinet. Open up the drawer, and you see tabs with some sort of name or other detail that indicates the contents of the folder.The tabs are easily seen and selectable, and they are often in some order, like alphabetical or chronological. The tabs on the files have similar functions to the index of an array. Just as the tabs serve as organized markers that point to certain folders, the index of an array is organized numerically (starting at 0), and each subsequent number points to the next value in the array.
  </p>

    Hashes, like arrays, are ordered collections. However, hash collections are not limited to indexing with an integer. Hash collections can be indexed by any object. In this way, the index and the value create a key/value pair that behaves like a dictionary. A certain key points to a certain value, and the user can access the value by passing the key to the hash.

    Put a different way, hashes are like a closet. You start a closet by giving it a name because it is your closet. Let's call one: my_closet. Imagine that you have your dream closet. It's gigantic, enormous, all-around ridiculous in size. When you put things (it's so big that it's not just for clothes) in my_closet you fear you will never see them again, so you attach a uniquely ID'd microchip to the item and send it into the great beyond. The microchip can be called from a digital interface that you conveniently just found right on the doors of my_closet. Neat! Now you just have to input the unique ID, and my_closet will present your item to you in the same condition that it was stored. In the interpreter, it looks something like this: my_closet[unique_ID] = closet_item.
