<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was a little awkward at first. I let my imagination off the leash and was trying to create something a little too complicated for our purposes. After we settled in and worked through a couple mistakes we pulled out a simple wireframe and an easy HTML template.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I think it was nice to have the picture put in front of me while we were thinking and talking through what the HTML should look like. Also, I think the act of drawing the boxes helped my mind to box out the different sections. I'm unsure of the benefit of having a digital copy of a wireframe. I could have drawn it on a piece of paper in far less time.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  Simplicity. When we were confused with the details of HTML, it was nice to have a drawing that was easy to look at to remind us of the simple look we were going for.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  I learned about <pre>, which is like <p> but it keeps the format of the text so you can add indents and spaces and open lines without additional elements.
