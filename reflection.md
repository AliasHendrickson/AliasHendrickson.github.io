**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
  I learned that I have a lot to learn. Borders are nice for making certain elements pop off the screen. Margins are tough. I had to force myself to move on because I was running myself in circles. I could very easily spend a day or two in CSS and not notice.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
  I learned that the language is not as straight forward as I thought. I had different definitions in my head for absolute and relative than what is actually happening with the elements, so when I went to change something it would run all around in ways I did not expect. It's fun and frustrating.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
  I kept my design pretty simple for now. Colors, sizing, and font style were the easiest choices. I'll still mess with structure as I go. Positioning and keeping things where they should be was by far the toughest.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
  There is so much to do! I love it. Design is one of my favorite new hobbies, and I will be formatting my site a lot over these next few months.
