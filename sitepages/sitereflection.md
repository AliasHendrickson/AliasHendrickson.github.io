**How was your experience translating a wireframe into HTML?**
  It was tricky. I realized that even though I had an idea in my head of what the site would look like, when I coded it and brought it to life it did not match up exactly with the image in my mind. This was a good learning experience.

**What new tricks or elements did you learn about in HTML?**
  I learned how to size an image. I learned how to code links into the navigation bar so that the user can navigate between each one. At first I would click on one link and then not be able to click on any of the others from the new page. I had to set the paths up correctly on each link. I also learned that a picture can be part of the main header.

**Are you excited to start incorporating the design you chose next week?**
  I am very excited to start designing next week. Now that I sort of have a template to work with I can't wait to make it look clean.
